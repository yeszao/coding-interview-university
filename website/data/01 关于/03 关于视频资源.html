Some videos are available only by enrolling in a Coursera, EdX, or Lynda.com class. These are called MOOCs.
Sometimes the classes are not in session so you have to wait a couple of months, so you have no access. Lynda.com courses are not free.

    I'd appreciate your help to add free and always-available public sources, such as YouTube videos to accompany the online course videos.
    I like using university lectures.
