    When I started this project, I didn't know a stack from a heap, didn't know Big-O anything, anything about trees, or
    how to
    traverse a graph. If I had to code a sorting algorithm, I can tell ya it wouldn't have been very good.
    Every data structure I've ever used was built into the language, and I didn't know how they worked
    under the hood at all. I've never had to manage memory unless a process I was running would give an "out of
    memory" error, and then I'd have to find a workaround. I've used a few multidimensional arrays in my life and
    thousands of associative arrays, but I've never created data structures from scratch.</p>

    It's a long plan. It may take you months. If you are familiar with a lot of this already it will take you a lot less
    time.
